### KG Integrated in Hypothesis Set (e.g., the definition of a neural networkâ€™s architecture and hyper-parameters, or choosing model structure)

#### (1) GNN + KGs as external sources

1. The more you know: Using knowledge graphs for image classification (CVPR 2017)
> * Inference about a particular object is facilitated by using relations to other objects in an image.
2. Symbolic graph reasoning meets convolutions (NIPS 2018)
> * A graph reasoning layer can be inserted into any neural network, which enhances the representations in a given layer by propagating through a given knowledge graph.

#### (2) Attention mechanisms on a knowledge graph in order to enhance features
1. Knowledge enhanced contextual word representations (EMNLP 2019)
> * Attention on related knowledge graph embedding can support the training of word embeddings.
2. Commonsense knowledge aware conversation generation with graph attention (IJCAI 2018)
> * Use attention on KG to facilitate the understanding and generation of conversational text.
