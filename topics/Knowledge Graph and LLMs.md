> * ⭐ Interesting!! Key point: ChatGPT is trained on information from different data sources. Thus, it does not generalize to unseen domain information.
> * Advanced KG Chatbots could be developed by incorporating capabilities of language models, such as ChatGPT, in question understanding, robustness, and explainability, with the
outstanding capabilities of a QA system, such as KGQAN, in incorporating recent information and generality across different domains.
