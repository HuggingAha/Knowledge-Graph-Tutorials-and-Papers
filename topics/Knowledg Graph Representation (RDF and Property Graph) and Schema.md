## Knowledg Graph Representation (RDF and Property Graph) and Schema
There are two major approaches to store and query knowledge graphs: (1) RDF (Resource Description Framework) data model with SPARQL query language, (2) property graph model with graph query languages such as Cypher. 

## RDF Graphs
__Surveys__
1. RDF Data Storage and Query Processing Schemes: A Survey [[Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3177850)]

__General Papers__
1. Relational schema optimization for RDF-based knowledge graphs (Information Systems 2021) [[Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437921000223)] 

__Queries and Search over RDF based KG__

__1. Keyword search__

__1.1 Summary Graph Based Approaches__

2. Scalable keyword search on large rdf data (TKDE 2014)
3. Finding top-k min-cost connected trees in databases (ICDE 2007)
4. Keyword search over RDF graphs (CIKM 2011)
5. Keyword searching and browsing in databases using BANKS (ICDE 2002)
