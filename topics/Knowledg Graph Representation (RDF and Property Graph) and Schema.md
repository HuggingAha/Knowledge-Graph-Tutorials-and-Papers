## Knowledg Graph Representation (RDF and Property Graph) and Schema
There are two major approaches to store and query knowledge graphs: (1) RDF (Resource Description Framework) data model with SPARQL query language, (2) property graph model with graph query languages such as Cypher.

__Queries and Search over RDF based KG__

__1. Keyword search__

__1.1 Summary Graph Based Approaches__
1. Top-k exploration of query candidates for efficient keyword search on graph-shaped (rdf) data (ICDE 2009) ðŸŒŸ
2. Finding top-k min-cost connected trees in databases (ICDE 2007) ðŸŒŸ
3. Keyword search over RDF graphs (CIKM 2011) ðŸŒŸ
> * [2] and [3] define the keyword search problem as a minimum connected tree [2] or a subgraph [3] over the data graph, while the target is to cover all the keyword by the nodes and edges of the derived tree or subgraph.
> * This problem definition is very close to the group Steiner tree problem (GST), which is proven to be NP-complete.
> * DPBF [2] guarantees to derive the exact optimal result of a minimum-weight GST with parameterized time complexity. However, DPBF still suffers from the exponential time and space complexity, especially on large graphs. Moreover, DPBF cannot generate a solution until the entire algorithm is completed.
4. Keyword searching and browsing in databases using BANKS (ICDE 2002) ðŸŒŸ
5. Bidirectional expansion for keyword search on graph databases (VLDB 2005)
6. BLINKS:rankedkeyword searches on graphs (SIGMOD 2007)
> * BANKS [4], BANKS-II [5], and BLINKS [6], which propose approximate algorithms. BANKS merges paths from keyword vertices to approximate a minimum-weight GST, while BANKS-II further improves the performance of BANKS by conducting bidirectional search. In addition, BLINKS exploits the precomputed distances and graph partitioning to further improve the efficiency of the bidirectional search.
7. Scalable keyword search on large rdf data (TKDE 2014) ðŸŒŸ
> * The search can also be pruned based on the graph summaries. The RDF data is first condensed into a generic graph, while the entity vertex with the corresponding keyword and type vertices are merged together. A type-based summarization approach is then proposed to speed up the search performance.
8. Efficient and Progressive Group Steiner Tree Search (SIGMOD 2016) ðŸŒŸ
> * To address the two limitations in [2], PrunedDP [8] is developed with optimal-tree decomposition techniques and conditional tree merging strategies. The search space of the parameterized DP algorithm is significantly reduced, and progressively-refined feasible solutions are conducted during the execution of the algorithm.
